        <h3>Section One - Self-Hypnosis</h3>
<p>&emsp;When you think about hypnosis, you can't help but picture the stereotypical scene of a magician at a fair. He's usually standing on stage with a pocket watch dangling from his hand, swinging back and forth while he puts some poor fool into his power.</p>
<p>&emsp;He says something about the person going to sleep and then starts snapping his fingers. The subject falls backwards as if in a deep slumber. Then, the "hypnotist" tells them they are a dog or a chicken or whatever else and makes them do weird shit like bark or cluck. This is followed by the hypnotist telling them that when they wake up, they will feel refreshed and full of energy and won't remember anything until someone snaps their fingers twice or makes a clicking sound or some other trigger.</p>
<p>&emsp;Now, while this is the typical example of hypnosis, it isn't the only form. You don't have to be put under by someone to go into a trance. In fact, most people experience hypnotic trances many times throughout the day without even knowing it. Have you ever been driving down the highway and suddenly realized you had driven for ten minutes without being aware of what was happening? That's called highway hypnosis. Perhaps you've been reading a book and become so absorbed in it that you blocked out everything around you. That's another common occurrence of the trance state.</p>
<p>&emsp;Anytime your attention becomes focused and excluded to one thing, you enter a light level of hypnosis. It happens all the time.  But there IS such a thing as self-hypnosis. All it involves is learning how to give yourself suggestions using simple techniques. For instance, let's say you want to stop smoking (or start smoking). When you go to bed, just lay there and relax. Take slow easy breaths. Imagine yourself surrounded by a warm glow of light. Imagine that each time you inhale, the light moves upward a little bit. Each inhalation brings the light higher and higher until finally, you're completely engulfed in a bright white cloud of light. Keep taking these slow, deep breaths while imagining yourself basking in the cloud. Feel yourself relaxing more and more. Once you reach an acceptable level of relaxation, begin giving yourself the suggestion. Say over and over, either silently or aloud, "I WILL NOT SMOKE ANYMORE!" Repeat it several times and imagine that each time you repeat it, you believe it more and more.</p>
<p>&emsp;After about five minutes of repeating the phrase, open your eyes and get up. Chances are you'll find that you actually DO have less desire to smoke than before! I know this sounds crazy, but it works. Just try it. The same technique has worked for my friends who wanted to quit biting their nails or overeating. Of course, this technique doesn't work overnight. It takes several days to a week before you notice any results. But it does work!</p>
<p>&emsp;Another way to induce a self-induced trance is through the use of a pendulum. A pendulum is simply something weighted so it hangs freely and swings. Many people use a crystal attached to a chain, others use their car keys, still others use a fishing weight tied to string. If you were to take a weight and hang it from a thread and let it dangle over your knee, eventually it would come to rest and remain motionless. This is due to gravity. However, if you concentrate on the weight and visualize it moving slowly back and forth along your leg in a straight line, after a few moments, it will begin to move. Of course, you're not really MOVING the weight with your mind alone. What you ARE doing is sending minute signals to your arm, causing the pendulum to sway slightly. Still, you can bring the movement under conscious control fairly easily. Try it sometime!</p>
<p>&emsp;Ok, now once you've got the pendulum moving, continue to concentrate and make the movement smooth and rhythmic. Watch the pendulum carefully and clear your mind of all thoughts except for the movement of the weight. Soon you should find yourself entering a light trance. Your eyelids may grow heavy and you might feel groggy and sleepy. You might also experience a slight numbing sensation in your hands and feet. These are signs that you have entered hypnosis.</p>
<p>&emsp;So, now comes the question: Why do this? Well, there are two reasons. First off, if you do it correctly, when you awaken from the trance, you'll feel very relaxed and free from tension. Secondly, there are ways for you to program your subconscious mind during self-hypnosis which will enable you to change your behavior patterns, increase concentration, improve memory, etc. Simply follow the steps outlined above, replacing the statement about quitting smoking with whatever it is you wish to accomplish.</p>
<p>&emsp;There are many books on the market today dealing with self- hypnosis and auto-suggestion. Almost all of them contain some valuable information. I suggest that you pick up a couple of them and read them. Experiment. See what works best for YOU! Also, you can have fun with hypnosis. For example, next time you see a movie in a theater, right before it begins, tell yourself that you will become so involved in the film that nothing will distract you. Guess what will happen? Nothing WILL distract you! Even though you are fully awake, you will be totally unaware of anyone talking in the audience or other disturbances.</p>
<p>&emsp;Let me leave you with a final thought about hypnosis: IT CAN'T MAKE YOU DO SOMETHING AGAINST YOUR WILL OR MORAL CODES! NO MATTER HOW DEEP THE TRANCE STATE, IF SOMEONE TRIES TO GIVE YOU A SUGGESTION THAT VIOLATES YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS AND VALUES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REFUSE IT! So, don't worry about being made to act like a fool in public by some jerk trying to impress his buddies. That kind of stuff only happens in the movies...</p>
<h3>Section Two - Meditation</h3>
<p>&emsp; Meditation is the process of training your mind to focus all its attention on ONE THING AT A TIME. It can be used to reduce stress, increase concentration and memory, achieve inner peace, communicate telepathically, enhance psychic ability, and provide entertainment. There are millions of different methods of meditating, each one having strengths and weaknesses. Here I am presenting three basic types: Zen, Transcendental, and Guided Imagery.</p>
<p>&emsp;Zen Meditation:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The essence of Zen Meditation is to clear your mind of ALL intrusive thoughts. Basically, you sit cross-legged, close your eyes, breathe deeply and regularly, and attempt to keep your mind blank. Sounds simple, right? WRONG! The first time you try it, you'll discover just what I mean. Don't worry if you fall asleep the first time or your mind wanders...it's normal. As long as you keep practicing, eventually you'll be able to master it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; The key to successful Zen meditation lies in your posture. If you sit comfortably, your body will relax and allow you to concentrate better. Begin by sitting in your favorite chair, couch, desk, floor, wherever. Close your eyes and begin breathing deeply. Take a deep breath IN, hold it for a moment, and slowly exhale. Do this repeatedly and soon you'll find yourself growing calmer and more relaxed. While you're breathing, try to block out all distracting noises and concentrate ONLY on your own rhythmic pattern of respiration. Try to force extraneous thoughts OUT OF YOUR MIND! Eventually (after MUCH practice) you'll succeed in clearing your head. At that point, simply enjoy the feeling of not THINKING for awhile!</p>
<p>   Transcendental Meditation:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;   Transcendental Meditation is similar to Zen Meditation except instead of forcing your brain to think about NOTHING, you focus upon a single word or phrase. This is called a MANTRA. A mantra can be any word, phrase, or sound which helps you to concentrate and meditate. Some examples are: "AUM", "OM", or "OOOMMMMM". I prefer the following mantra because it allows me to breath smoothly and evenly: "IN...OUT...IN...OUT..." (You can substitute "up" and "down" if you prefer.) Now, here's how you do TM...</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;  Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed for at least fifteen minutes. Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Breathe deeply and rhythmically while chanting your mantra either aloud or mentally. Keep repeating the words in your mind. Concentrate solely upon the mantra. Block out everything else. After approximately ten to twenty minutes, gradually allow your awareness to return to reality. Open your eyes and look around. You should feel extremely calm and alert. With enough practice, you can learn to drop into a transcendental meditation almost instantaneously. This can help alleviate headaches, relieve anxiety, and provide a quick escape from stressful situations.</p>
<p>&emsp;  Guided Imagery Meditation:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Guided imagery is probably the simplest form of meditation. All it requires is a fertile imagination. Are you ready? Good. Get comfortable. Make sure no one can bother you. Pick out a pleasant fantasy image. For example, perhaps you'd enjoy lying on a sandy beach listening to waves lap against the shore. Or maybe you'd rather experience floating gently on a cloud high above the cares and worries of the world below. Whatever your choice, make sure it appeals to you. Now, close your eyes and begin visualizing your "happy place". Form a clear mental picture of the scene. Examine every detail. Use ALL of your senses. Not just sight, but touch, taste, smell, hearing, too. Imagine the warmth of the sun on your face; hear the cry of seagulls overhead; smell the salt spray in the air; feel the sand beneath your toes; taste the food you brought along in your picnic basket. Lose yourself in the fantasy. Enjoy it. Stay there for as long as you like. When you decide to end the session, slowly allow your mind to return to reality. Open your eyes and notice how refreshed you feel! With guided imagery meditation, the possibilities are endless. Anything you can dream, you can experience!</p>
<p>&emsp;Those are three of the hundreds of meditation techniques available. They are among the easiest to learn and require little or no expense on your part. All they cost is a little bit of effort and patience. Try them and see which one suits you best. Remember, the main purpose behind meditation is to RELAX! If you find yourself becoming frustrated or stressed-out, STOP! Come back to it later. Always maintain a positive attitude and NEVER FORCE YOURSELF TO CONTINUE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO! The whole idea is to ENJOY the experience. If you aren't enjoying it, you aren't doing it right!</p>
<p> * Section Three - Breathing Techniques *</p>
<p>&emsp;Proper breathing is crucial to maintaining physical health. Deep breathing exercises are important parts of Yoga, Tai Chi, Karate, Judo, Wrestling, and numerous other activities. By mastering the art of correct breathing, you can dramatically improve your stamina, endurance, and overall well-being. Here are the basics...</p>
<p>&emsp;STOMACH BREATHING EXERCISES</p>
<p>&emsp;Lie flat on your back on the floor or on your bed. Place your hands on your stomach. Slowly draw a deep breath. Hold it for a second and then exhale. Notice how your abdomen rises and falls with each breath. Practice breathing deeply and rhythmically in this manner for a few moments. Next, try raising both legs about six inches off the ground and holding them there while continuing the stomach breathing. Finally, raise your arms above your head and point your toes. Again, keep breathing slowly and steadily. Remain in that position as long as possible while concentrating on the rise and fall of your chest. This exercise strengthens your abdominal muscles and improves oxygen intake.</p>
<p>&emsp;CHEST EXPANSION EXERCISES</p>
<p>&emsp;Stand upright facing a wall. Extend your left arm and press your palm firmly against the surface. Draw a deep breath and hold it briefly. Now, exhale slowly while pressing harder against the wall with your palm. Continue till all the air is expelled from your lungs. Wait a second or two and repeat the procedure with your right arm. Alternate back and forth between hands. With each exhalation try to push harder against the wall and squeeze more air out of your lungs. This will increase lung capacity and strengthen chest muscles. </p>
<p>&emsp;BACK ARCHING EXERCISES</p>
<p>&emsp;Lie face down on a soft mat or rug. Bring your hands up beside your head and lace your fingers together. Now, keeping your hips on the floor, use your arms to arch your back upwards. Hold it for a few seconds and lower yourself. Repeat several times. This activity stretches the spine and increases flexibility.</p>
<p>&emsp;These are only a FEW of the thousands of breathing techniques available. I suggest you invest in a good book on Yoga, Tai Chi, Etc. and read further.</p>
<h3>Section Four - Visualization</h3>
<p>&emsp;Visualization is simply the ability to create clear mental images of objects, events, places, people, colors, emotions, etc. inside your mind. Everyone possesses this talent. It is what enables us to recall memories from our past or daydream about future goals and ambitions. Most people don't realize that visualization can be voluntarily controlled. By learning to consciously direct your visual sense, you can reap many benefits. Improved concentration, heightened awareness, increased creativity, enhanced imagination, better memory, relief from boredom, and a general uplifting of spirits.  In addition, you can use visualization as a method of increasing your ESP abilities, precognitive skills, astral projection powers, and lucid dreaming talents. The potential uses are endless!</p>
<p>&emsp;Before you can actively employ visualization techniques to aid in mind expansion, you must first hone your natural ability to see pictures in your mind's eye. This requires daily practice and perseverance. Follow these steps in order to sharpen your visualization skill...</p>
<p>&emsp;Step One: Select a small object to serve as your target. Something like a pen, marble, paper clip, eraser, book, coin, etc. will work fine. Choose an item which is familiar and convenient.</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Two: Study the object closely. Examine every aspect of it. Use all your senses. Look at it, smell it, listen to it, feel it, and taste it. Notice details about it. Is it sharp or dull? Rough or smooth? Heavy or light? Hot or cold?</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Three: Place the object on a table directly in front of you. Move to one side and observe it from various angles. Turn it upside-down and examine the bottom. Memorize its features.</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Four: Return the object to its original position. Close your eyes and visualize it in your mind. Picture it clearly. Mentally view it from all sides. Pay particular attention to the color, shape, size, and condition of the object. Can you distinguish textures and individual characteristics? How accurate is the image compared to the real thing?</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Five: Open your eyes and check your accuracy. Compare the actual appearance of the article with your mental impression of it. Note similarities and differences. Try again, this time making adjustments in your visualization to compensate for inaccuracies.</p>
<p>&emsp;Repeat these steps frequently using various items of differing shapes and sizes. Gradually increase the difficulty by adding motion to the equation. Visualize a ball bouncing across a room, a bird flying through the sky, a wave rolling onto the shore. Learn to visualize living creatures such as cats, dogs, horses, fish, people. Attempt to visualize things that normally can't be seen like atoms, molecules, radio waves, electricity, gravity, etc. Strive to perfect your visualization ability till you can vividly recreate objects in your mind at will. This is the foundation upon which future efforts will be built. Until you master the rudiments of visualization, advancement is impossible. So, don't rush into subsequent stages prematurely. Instead, spend ample time honing your innate talents. The extra effort expended now will save much aggravation later on!</p>
<p>&emsp;Once you develop adequate proficiency in seeing simple concrete objects in your imagination, proceed to the next step of advanced visualization: abstract thinking. Abstract thinking differs from concrete thinking in that abstract thought deals with ideas, concepts, feelings, emotions, abstractions, etc. whereas concrete thought pertains to visible tangible substances. Concrete thinking is limited by the boundaries of sensory experience while abstract thinking transcends physical laws and explores the realm of unlimited possibilities.</p>
<p>&emsp;An example of abstract thinking is found in Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Einstein conceived the theory during a visualization experiment. He imagined himself traveling alongside a beam of light for billions of light years. He observed the effects of acceleration approaching the speed of light. From this mental journey sprang the entire basis for modern physics as we know it today! Another illustration of abstract thought occurs in mathematics. Mathematicians solve problems involving numbers by manipulating symbols according to established rules. They seldom rely on physical representations of the quantities they deal with. Instead, they utilize short cuts known as algorithms which enable them to arrive at solutions quickly and efficiently. Using abstract methods, mathematicians perform operations beyond the scope of ordinary calculation.</p>
<p>&emsp;Now, to cultivate your abstract thinking capability, try the following procedure... </p>
<p>&emsp;Step One: Pick out an emotion to focus your attention on. Emotions such as anger, sadness, happiness, surprise, disgust, love, hate, fear, confusion, doubt, jealousy, envy, greed, lust, apathy, pain, depression, joy, ecstasy, serenity, peace, contentment, harmony, bewilderment, shock, grief, pleasure, pride, humility, trust, faith, confidence, courage, bravery, cowardice, terror, panic, horror, etc., make excellent targets. Choose whichever appeals to you currently.</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Two: Recall a recent incident when you experienced this emotion strongly. Relive that experience in your mind. Recreate the feelings associated with it. Remember how it felt emotionally, physically, psychologically. Allow yourself to be swept up in the event.</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Three: Separate yourself from the situation. View it objectively as an outsider looking in. Analyze your actions. Ask yourself why you behaved the way you did. Determine whether your reaction was appropriate given the circumstances. Evaluate alternative responses and outcomes.</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Four: Summarize your conclusions regarding the emotional impact of the encounter. Did it affect you positively or negatively? Would you react differently next time faced with comparable conditions? Has it altered your perception of life in any significant manner?</p>
<p>&emsp;Step Five: Dismiss from consciousness all traces of the previous emotion. Wipe away any residual influences lingering within your psyche. Clear your mind completely. Prepare for the next trial run.</p>
<p>&emsp;Repeat these steps frequently selecting new emotions to explore. Discover how each affects you personally. Learn to recognize warning signs indicating imminent eruptions of volatile passions. Develop strategies for controlling unruly impulses before they get out of hand. Refine your emotional sensitivity toward subtle nuances of interpersonal communication. Acquire insight into human motivation and behavior patterns. Attune yourself to the needs of others besides your own selfish desires. Cultivate empathy for those less fortunate than yourself. Expand your compassion for fellow human beings everywhere. Become aware of universal truths underlying diverse cultural values. Unite humanity under a banner of brotherhood and sisterhood across national borders. Promote understanding amongst people regardless of race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, political affiliation, economic status, educational background, social class, etc. Foster tolerance and acceptance of differences between individuals. Encourage cooperation and collaboration among groups working towards a common goal. Work diligently to establish lasting peace on Earth. Achieve enlightenment through selfless service to mankind. Realize Oneness with God through meditation and prayer. Experience Nirvana within this lifetime. Be reborn into another existence free from suffering and ignorance. Reach Buddhahood and attain ultimate liberation from samsara. Enter paradise and reside eternally in blissful communion with divinity. Know thyself and awaken to Reality. Live forevermore in eternal splendor. Reap the rewards of karmic merit accumulated over countless lifetimes. Receive divine blessings and guidance from enlightened masters and angels. Hear angelic voices singing praises unto the Lord. <|end_of_text|></p>
